===========================

We Need This When?
-------------

* Applications vs. decorated pages
* With multiple moving parts
* Probably backed by JSON services


Client-side architecture requirements
-------------------------------------

* Loose coupling
* Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Dry-ness
* Routing, application state

MVC variations
--------------

* Classic MVC (e.g. rails)
* MVVM, MVP
* Resource-View-Controller

Backbone.js
-----------

* Models, Collections
* Views (Controllers)
* Routes + Controller actions
* Events

No opinion
----------

* DOM interaction, querying
* Templating (basic templates supported)
* HTML, CSS ($ provided on views if available)
* Bootstrap
* Modules, script-loading

Dependencies
------------

* Underscore: utils, functional helpers
